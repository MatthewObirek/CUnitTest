# CUnitTest

This is an basic program that will Quiz the user on any topic. It requires only true or false, or multiple choice questions at the moment. Data that is to be used must be implemented directly into the code. Eventually I hope to add functionality that allows files in the same directory to be read.


To compile the program `make all` 
to run the Program: `./Out/Build/main `
