# CUnitTest

This is an basic program that will Quiz the user on any topic. It requires only true or false, or multiple choice questions at the moment. Data that is to be used must be implemented directly into the code. Eventually I hope to add functionality that allows files in the same directory to be read.

To implement the Far Off Goals, I want to use something like Cython, or another python rapper of C. I am not sure how that would work, but I am excited to try.

To compile the program `make all` 
to run the Program: `./Out/Build/main `
