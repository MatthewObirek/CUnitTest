# CUnitTest

This is a basic program that will quiz the user on any topic. It requires only true or false, or multiple choice questions at the moment. Data that is to be used must be implemented directly into the code. Unstable file reading has been addded. 
To run the build properly, use '$ ./main nameOfQuiz.txt'
